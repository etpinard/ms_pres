===============================================================================


- Title slide:

First of all, thanks for being here.

And thank you especially considering my talk is not
on the typical Thursday afternoon Dynamics seminar topic.

If I've just read the title thinking ... What is this?
Don't panic ... I have several introduction slides.

Hopefully I will convince you that is non-only it is an interesting topic 
but also an important one in climate science.

So, I am going to start by reading the title:
Linking "soil moisture" and "summertime surface temperature variability"

For us today the variability of interest will be of the inter-annual 
(year-to-year) type. 

Just as an example, heat waves are extreme inter-annual temperature events

I am going to use these the introduction the subject:


# Section 01

- slide 'why study temperature variability':

Heat waves have been in the news lately.

Last summer in central US. A pretty severe drought.

In 2010, Russia was hit hard. They had wild fires reaching Moscow!

And in 2003 over most of Europe. 

Non-only this particular event was very dramatic, 
but it also 
led to a lot of research on some of the concepts that I will talk about today.

And, first of all, people asked themselves 
 Is this a sign of things to come?
(as is often the case in climate science) ...
quite

- slide 'temperature variability projections':

This study here made use a two climate model simulations.
(1 historical and 1 climate change scenario)

The left panel is the mean surface temperature change, 
late 21st minus late 20th century.

And the right panel is relative change in the standard deviation of 
surface temperature. 

Contours in red are 100% change relative to the late 20th century climate.

A pretty significant signal. (Worth publishing a least ...)
(they did not detrend!)

Also \ notice that the patterns in mean and variability are not the same,
perhaps telling us that different mechanisms are at play.


- slide 'role of soil moisture':

And this is where soil moisture comes in.

This study here is pretty clean.
We've got 4 GCM runs.

2 20th century and scenario runs 
2 with evolving soil moisture and 2 constant soil moisture
  where land-atmosphere interactions are removed.

Here what's plotted is the standard deviation of surface temperature
in JJA. Red colors are the largest values.

By comparing each of the two left panels,
we isolate the effects of 'land-atmosphere interactions'

%%

We conclude that soil moisture (without knowing why at this point)
is related to the temperature variability trends.


- slide 'are GCMs reliable':

But, hold on. 

The two studies I just shown were based on GCM (climate model) simulations ...

Can we trust them?

And turns out that .... NO

This is CMIP5 ensemble mean of summer surface temperature variance.

I've got about 60 runs in there.

For those of you that are working with Dargan ... That folder!

So I compute that Var(T) in summer
(means JJA north of the equator, DJF south of the equator)
For all those models and then I average across the ensemble

What's plotted is the ratio with the observed value 

I used the U of Delaware data bank of gridded observations

(Also, I will be showing a lot of ratios of things in my talk,
 So, I think it is worth while to get familiar with the contour levels.

1 in this case means perfect. The ensemble agrees with observations.
Three levels up means that the numerator is twice as big as the denominator
Correspondingly three levels down mean that the denominator is twice as big.
And so on ... The contours are symmetric about a flip. )

Grays here are perfect within 10%

%%

But here, we see that most of globe the typical has a 25% to 100% positive bias.
The typical CMIP5 GCM has too much variance!


- slide 'questions':

So, we'll ask this simple question: 

Could the same mechanism that produce the 21s century summertime temperature
variance trends in the GCMs be responsible for the
20th century summertime Var(T) biases in the GCMs???

%%

So for us, we'll use the fact the GCM have large errors in the 20th century
as additional motivation for understanding how soil moisture
and surface temperature are related

With the intermediate step being land-atmosphere interactions.


- slide 'surface energy budget':

We'll start our investigation by looking at the surface energy budget.

%%

First, from the perspective of the land surface the 
net shortwave radiation + longwave down can be considered a forcing.

I will group those terms together for my talk call it the radiation forcing
with symbol F.

%%

Then, we have a couple turbulent flux terms, latent and sensible heat.

The latent heat flux is proportion to the evapotranspiration which includes
all fluxes of water from land to atmosphere 
(as you probably guessed, this be important in my talk).

Unfortunately evapotranspiration is a very long word.
I will sometimes refer to it as simply E.

%%

Then, upwelling longwave given by Stefan-Boltzmann 
and finally a ground heat flux term, rounding out the budget.


- slide 'Koster diagram':

As promised, I'll talk a little bit more about E.

And of course people have been thinking about these things long before me.

One framework that comes up a lot is this one here. The Koster diagram.

Which plots the latent heat flux normalized by net radiation at the surface
as a function of soil moisture.


It puts forward the concept of evapotranspiration regimes



It puts forward a certain value of moisture (m critical) where above it 
latent heat becomes independent of soil moisture 
and controlled only by net radiation.

E = E potential. This is the energy-limited E regime.

Below this critical value of moisture, E is strongly constrained by 
moisture availability.

This is the moisture-limited E regime.

This idea of two E regime is fundamental to my talk.
It is worth remembering.

%%

But there is problem. What about temperature variability.

The problem is: This is way too simple to be convincing

The link to surface temperature is not explicit.
It is only an 'all-things-being-equal' argument. 

(By the way I called this the Koster diagram ...)


- slide 'Feedback loops:

Some have postulated that soil moisture is involved 
in complex feedback loops with the atmosphere.

And, I am not going through these in details.

(If you are interested 
 I invite you to read this 2010 review paper on soil moisture and climate)

I only put the figures up to make a point.

%%

They are complicated.

And they can only be quantified via
GCM simulations, which as we've just shown, have large errors.

When trying to understanding mechanisms involving, this is far from ideal!


- slide 'something better':

So, let's attempt to develop a better framework.

Let's try to make the link between soil moisture, 
land-atmosphere interactions
and temperature variability explicit and quantifiable!

(unlike Koster)

While keeping things simple enough so that we don't have 
to rely on GCM simulations to get an understanding.

(unlike feedback loops)

%%

This is us today. 
Lying in-between the conceptual and the complex.

For lack of a better name, we'll call our framework, 
a toy model for summertime surface temperature variability.


- slide 'outline':

So, let's have an outline.

(The general goal of my project of my talk is to
 investigate how soil moisture and Var(T) are related.)

That was the introduction. That's done.

Next, I will introduce the datasets that we will working with.
We will also try to build insight on the problem from theses datasets.

The next section is where we will show how we derived the toy model.

Section four will be fun though.
This is where we will dissect what the toy model tells us.

And (if time permits) I will present one application for the toy model 
concerning late 21st century climate.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 02

- slide 'Datasets and definitions':

All right. Let me first introduce the datasets.

We'll be using 4. 2 GCMs and 2 Reanalyses.

And this is not a mistake, I am using models.

Observations of land surface variable such as soil moisture
are not available at big spatial and long enough temporal scales 
for climate studies like this one.

So we have to resort to models data to get insights.

I used two relatively old CMIP3 GCMs. (I apologize).
The ... Last 30 years of historical runs. 
The 2 reanalyses are the ... 

We are focusing on summer!
All plots and analysis that I will show next, will be for summer only.


- slide 'temperature variance errors':

Let's first evaluate the performance of the 4 datasets
in terms of temperature variance.

As with the CMIP5 ensemble that I showed earlier, 
I am plotting the surface temperature variance as a ratio with observations.

To no surprise, the reanalysis, on the right, 
perform better than the GCMs on the left. (esp. Era-40)

%% 

Let me highlight a couple regions.

GCMs feature hot spots of temperature variability where the variance 
is overestimate by a factor of 2 or even 4.


- slide 'Summertime mean soil moisture':

I next plot the mean soil moisture in mm of water.

This is the soil moisture in the top 10 cm.
These four datasets don't have the same total soil depth.
Picking the top 10 cm is a way to homogenize the results.

Unfortunately here, we can't compare the datasets to observations 
(because this is none at this scale).

%%

But by highlighting the same regions, the central US and Eastern Europe, 
we note that the GCM are much dryer than the reanalyses,
consistent with a link between soil moisture and Var(T).

A nice result.


- slide 'Correlations involving E':

Another important result involve evapotranspiration

I am going to show it using correlation coefficients 

The top panel is between evapotranspiration 
and radiation forcing (remember net ...) 

And the bottom is between E and soil moisture.

Here I am only showing hadgem1 data 
(but the results are consistent across the four datasets).

If you look at these long enough like I did ... You see that
Over most land locations 
E is "either" positively correlated with F or m
But, almost never both at the same simultaneously.

%%

If we focus on two locations. The two yellow dots.

We see that where E is negatively correlated with F 
it is positively correlated with m.

And vice-versa.

Which may look quite strange ...
Why would that be ? 

How can E decrease when radiation (top panel) 
  and moisture increase (bottom panel)?

I will answer this question on the following slide

But first, let's make a very important 
association involving (you've guessed it) soil moisture.

Let's assume that the positive correlations here happen
to be causal.

Let's propose that 
E responds to soil moisture anomalies (like in Texas)
in places where soils are 'dry' on average?
(that would make sense right???)

And what if E responds 
to radiation anomalies in places where soils are 'wet'

Like in the Koster Diagram!

To me,
the easiest way to separate dry from wet
was to compute the global mean soil moisture value.

And what I'll do next is to superpose on the plot here 
the line where mean soil moisture
is equal to that global mean soil moisture value.

That way we will separate
dryer than average soils from wetter than average soils.

This will come out in green.

%%

And no, this is not the zero correlation contour. 
It just works that well.

Looking at the bottom panel :
Dry soils (such as the central US, continental Eurasia, Australia)
are associated with the 'moisture-limited' response 

%%

In contrast:
Wet soils (such as tropics, high latitudes --- because of snow melt)
are associated with the 'energy-limited' response

!!
We have just associated the two E regimes 
to the summertime mean soil moisture. Not bad.
!!


- slide 'Correlations invoking E 2'

Now to explain:
the non-casual negative correlation

Here, by the way, the top 2 panels are the same as on the previous slide. 

For this, precipitation is key!

Precipitation is both a source of soil moisture
and a sink of radiation (through increased cloudiness)

Now, the idea is to decompose radiation forcing anomalies
(primes for anomalies)
into a part explained by precipitation (P, ... L is latent heat of vaporization,
making alpha the regression coefficient unitless).

We will call the (orthogonal) residual F_0',
the non-precipitating.

For most of the globe, alpha is positive.
Increased P decreases F !

And now, let's correlate F_0 with E and this will be the bottom panel.

%%

Over dry soils like Texas in yellow, F_0 is orthogonal to E.

Going back to the top panel:
We conclude that only precipitating radiation anomalies 
contribute to those negative correlations

%%

So, over dry soils, increased radiation is associated with
less precipitating cloud and soil moisture deficit which decreases E!

As pictured in the top panel

In contrast, over wet soils, increased moisture is associated with
more precipitating cloud -- an energy deficit

Explaining the negative correlations (in the middle panel)


This marks an important first step in building the toy model.
To understanding our E behaves, 
We must separate the radiative effect of P' from its effect on soil moisture.


Was this clear?
This is probably a good time for questions.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 03

- slide 'toy model preliminaries':

OK. Let's switch gears.

Now, I will show you how we derived the toy model.

In the next couple slides, 
I will go through the assumptions and the method that I used.

So, our goal is it the form an simple expression 
for the surface temperature variance.

Our tools are the surface energy budget,
a soil moisture budget that I will show on the following slide, 

And a parameterization scheme that of important land surface processes.

We'll focus on inter-annual variability.

We use monthly-averaged outputs

Each variable is decomposed with respect to monthly climatology 
This way we remove the annual cycle.


- slide 'toy model preliminary results':

So after decomposing every variable and assuming that the budgets
balance in the mean,

We obtain budget equations for the anomalies
Two of them. One for surface energy and one for soil moisture.

New terms in the moisture budget: P precipitation , R surface runoff 
and I the infiltration of soil water downwards (which could also be positive)

T is the 2-meter temperature allowing us to compare to observations.
C_eff is the effective heat capacity of the land surface.

%%

We will use the top 10 cm soil moisture for our soil moisture budget.

This turns out to be a very important step for this project

%%

As scale analysis reveals that both storage term are relatively small

So, we're going to drop them!

(this would not be the case, if m was taken to be the full soil column)

%%

Then, this allows us to define the ground heat flux and infiltration 
(which are not model date archives), as to close out both budgets.


- slide 'toy model assumptions':

Schematically, this is what we are dealing with.

The toy model presents the land-surface as subject
to two forcings radiation and precipitation (in red)

Two state variable T', m' 

And six fluxes originating from the land surface (in blue)

We'll make a 1st simplification by assuming that the both forcings are true
forcings, independent of the land surface.

And that the six blue arrows can parameterize 
as functions of the forcing and state variables only.

So four possible predictors for each of the blue arrows.

So that the state variable will functions of the forcing only.

That way we are 'closing' (if you want) the response of the land surface.


- slide 'toy model method':

Moving on the methodology.

I thought the easiest way to go through the algorithm is by example.

So, let's consider the ground heat flux 

%%

First let's regress G' onto the possible predictors. 
We have 4!

Every time we do this we get a coefficient 'a'
and a regressions residual G_0'.
Which can be different from one dataset to the next.

And, the best predictor will the one the minimizes the variance of residual.

%%

If 1 predictor is not enough --> we repeat this procedure 
for the residual 

After some trial and error, I was able to 
get better results by adding a second step

%%

Here is it:

If T' is a candidate (if it appears to do OK ...)

Substitute the parameterization (here G'= a T') into the 
surface energy budget 

Allowing us to evaluate the performance of the parameterization  
against the datasets own' temperature output.

The best parameterization will have the smallest RMS.

And so on for the other 5 terms ...

... Trial and errors mostly ...


- slide 'toy model parameterization':

OK, now that we set up the problem.
Let me state the results.

And therefore condensing 6 months of work in 1 slide.
But anyway there is it.

%%

3 out of the 6 terms were easy to parameterize.

Unambiguously, 1 predictor was enough for those terms.

We'll parameterize the ground heat flux with T',
Same upwelling longwave 
and runoff with P'.

%%

We needed 2 predictor for infiltration m' and P'

%%

Next, I had to use a special scheme for evapotranspiration
to model both regimes.

If soils are moisture limited m' and F'

If sols are energy limited F' only

%%

And finally, I got surprising result for the sensible heat flux

Soil moisture was the best predictor. 

The correlation is negative !

(I did looked into why this would be the case ..
 But it remains one of the unanswered questions of my project.)

Regardless we had to use two predictors T' and m'

Now, after each regression we get a coefficient ...



- slide 'Term-by-Term'

And after some algebra we get: an expression for T' and m' 

They look like this!

Simple. Algebraic ... No time derivative ...

(I put a hat and a subscript tm for toy model to highlight that these are only
approximation)

It is useful to decompose F' again using P' (as we did previously)
making the two forcing orthogonal.
L is the latent heat of vaporization.

let me quickly run through the coefficients ...

%%

Gamma has units of Wm-2K-1 a sort of surface temperature resistance

%%

Lambda regression evapotranspiration onto F

%%

Beta is ***

%%

We have a term proportional to soil moisture anomalies.
Where soil moisture induces E and H_s of opposite signs.

%%

Then, by substituting m' into the expression for T', we an expression
for T' as a function of the forcings only as desired.

By doing so, all contributions of soil moisture to T'
will be modulated by the coupling coefficient 
(a ratio of time scales, chi for coupling).

Importantly chi can be positive or negative!!


- slide 'toy model performance':

Now let's check how good of an approximation 
the toy model is ...

I am plotting a ratio of the toy model temperature variance to the each of the
datasets' temperature variance. 

A perfect toy model would have a ratio of one.

We see that for most of the globe the toy model underestimate the datasets.

%%

More clearly, this is a histogram of all land points,

In most grid points, the toy model has a negative bias of 20 to 40%

Which is not bad. Right?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 04 

- slide 'Interpreting the toy model':

OK. Now that we have this relatively simple expression 
for the temperature variance. 
  
It is a function of two forcings and a set of toy model coefficients.

Let's try to dissect what it tell us.

Unfortunately I won't have time to show all the analysis that I did.

Namely answering these two equations.

Do the toy model coefficients show dependence on mean-state variable ?

It turns out that yes.

Also, it turns out that the relative contributions of 
two forcings to temperature variance depend on the location.

%%

Instead, I will try answer the following question 

What is the role of soil moisture on temperature variability?

Or really, as we will see, what is the role of mean soil moisture 
and soil moisture anomalies on Var(T).


- slide 'Role of land surface on Var(T)':

And to the so ... 
Let's try isolate the effect of land-surface in the toy model.

So starting from the toy model expression for Var(T)

%%

Notice that by setting two coefficients to zero (in green)

We get that the surface temperature variance is proportional
to the external forcings.

%%

The next step is to define a unitless ratio that I called the 
surface response response.

So that if this ratio is equal to 1 
we can conclude that the land surface has no effect on Var(T).

And conversely if it differs from 1, the land surface does impact Var(T).

And I will plot this ratio next. (for the 4 datasets)


- slide 'Two regimes of Var(T)':

This is what we get.

We see that we have both values bigger and smaller than 1.

Meaning that the land surface can either amplify or damped 
Var(T)

That is, we have 2 regimes of surface temperature variability
as we had 2 evapotranspiration regimes.

A land-surface amplified (in the brown )
and a land-surface damped regime (the greens ).

And next I will show that they are basically equivalent

I will do this using soil moisture

Let me superpose the line where soil moisture
is equal to the global mean (separating dry and wet soils)

This will come in yellow this time

%%

So, we see that 

Dry soils amplify Var(T) 
And wet soils damp Var(T) ...

Correspondingly moisture-limited E amplifies Var(T)
energy-limited E damps Var(T)

Not bad at all


- slide 'Land-surface amplified regime':

Let me show you how land (soil moisture) 
can amplify and damped variability.

Starting in the land-surface amplified regime

And let's look at orthogonal component of the forcings separately.

I think this is the easiest way.

A non-precipitating forcing anomaly by itself warm the surface
(so it is in red)

The amplified regime is associated with the moisture-limited 
evapotranspiration does not respond to radiation.

In the toy model that quantified by lambda.

So the forcing in unattenuated. 

%%

Now, a precipitating forcing anomalies by itself cools through increased
cloudiness. (a blue arrow)

The increased in cloudiness does not impact E (again quantified by lambda)

Also, it a source of soil moisture, which some of it runoffs and infiltrates.

%%

And this soil moisture anomalies generates increased evapotranspiration 
and thus increased latent cooling.

This is somewhat offset by sensible heat.

But, the net effect of the turbulent fluxes is too cool. (again a blue arrow)

(This is quantifies by chi in the toy model!)

(blue forcing generates a blue flux) 
We have an amplification of the effects of the forcing via soil moisture!

(Flipping the sign given an anomalously low precip summer,

two effects add up: ... )


- slide 'Land-surface damped regime':

Now in the damped regime:

Remember this is associated with wet soils and the 
energy-limited E 

So here, increased radiation is damped by increased latent cooling.

Red arrows and blue arrows oppose each other.

%%

And there is small additional effect for the precipitation

Where a positive moisture anomaly reduces the sensible heat flux.

By some mechanism that I don't know of.

In the land-surface damped regime, soil moisture anomalies by themselves 
generate temperature anomalies of the opposite sign.

... Quite simple  ...


- slide 'recipe for Var(T)':

All this is probably a good time to have a summary slide ...

Temperature variability is regime dependent:

I describe this using 2 regimes:
A land-surface amplified or the land-surface damped given by 
this temperature response metric .

%%

In addition, both regimes have a long list of associations.

Here they are!

The amplified regime is associated 
with dryer than average soils, 
the moisture-limited E regime
and m' leading to temperature anomalies of the same sign.

In contrast, the damped regime is associated 
with wetter than average soils, 
the energy-limited E regime
and m' leading to temperature anomalies of the opposite sign.

And in a way, these statements are what my project is all about.

How many ways can we say the same thing. I got to 5.

With regards to soil moisture:

** mean state soil moisture set the regime
** depending on the regime, soil moisture anomalies amplify or damped 
** temperature variability.

The following question would be what control the magnitude 
of the response in each regime (talk to me after)

%% 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Section 05

- slide 'toy model applications':

OK. Now so now that we have this new framework for understanding 
and that we understand what it tells.

Let's apply it to specific problems.

The first I thought of was 'attributing'

I won't discuss it here (it is in the thesis though)

Instead let's see what the toy model can tell us 
about late 21st century projections.


- slide 'SRES A1b':

I used the same two GCMs as before and the A1b emission scenario.

Here is the relative change of soil moisture.

The black line is the (critical soil moisture value)
separating both E regimes.

%%

On the right is the temperate variance change plotted as a ratio ...

Let's focus in on the central US and Europe.

Where soils in the hadgem1 dry up near the critical soil moisture value.

%% 

And correspondingly Var(T) increases as we would expect from
a change of temperature variability regime.

( Var(T) is the ccsm3 does not amplify ... Soil moisture does not decrease)

( GCM projections are a strong function of 20th errors!)


- slide 'AR4':

OK. But that was only two GCMs.

Here is the ... 

The dots here represents regions where 80% of the models agree 
on sign of change. 

As in the hadgem1 the central US and Europe are expected to dry 
in the coming century.

Which would lead to increasing temperature variability in summer!
